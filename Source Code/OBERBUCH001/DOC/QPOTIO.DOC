XICOR X9241 QuadPot I/O Protocol
--------------------------------

This is similar to the I2C bus protocol from Phillips/Signetics,
but with a different addressing scheme.

Two bi-directional lines are used:

	SCL		Serial Clock  (only controlled by the master in this application)
	SDA		Serial Data

Initially, both SCL and SDA are HIGH in the IDLE state.

To CLEAR a possible acknowledge response:

	SCL is driven LOW by the master
	SCL is floated HIGH by the master
	SDA is floated HIGH by the master

The START state is entered when SDA is taken LOW by the master.

To TRANSMIT a bit:

	SCL is driven LOW by the master
	SDA is changed to the desired state by the master
	SCL is floated HIGH by the master
	SDA is sampled by the slave

To RECEIEVE a bit:

	SCL is driven LOW by the master
	SDA is changed to the desired state by the slave
	SCL is floated HIGH by the master
	SDA is sampled by the master

When 8 bits have been transferred an ACKNOWLEDGE cycle occurs:

	SCL is driven LOW by the master
	SDA is floated HIGH by the master
	SDA is driven LOW by the slave
	SCL is floated HIGH by the master
	SDA is sampled by the master and should be LOW

When all bytes are transmitted and acknowledged the STOP state is entered:

	SCL is driven LOW by the master
	SDA is driven LOW by the master
	SCL is floated HIGH by the master
	SDA is floated HIGH by the master
